Breaking down the rent, utils, elec, wifi, etc. took too much repetitive effort every month. 
Created this app using Claude code to simplify the process, and I just need to enter 3 values and it gives me complete breakdown. 

Needs no particular platform to run it, can be accessed directly from phone browser or desktop.
